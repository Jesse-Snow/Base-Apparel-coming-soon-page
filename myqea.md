# My Q&A

## What are the ways to do this?

- I Can use Flexbox
  - Adding 3 divs for the left side and 2 divs for the right side.
  - The 'logo div' in the right side will be visible only in mobile and vice-versa.
  - The left side will have 60% of widht in the flex container.
  - I can try mobile first
